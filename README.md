## üöÄ Description

This application leverages the latest web technologies to provide a seamless experience for content creators.

Subsequently, OpenAI's GPT model generates a blog post based on the transcription, mimicking the user's previous writing style for consistency. The platform includes user authentication, subscription plans managed via Stripe, a dashboard for managing posts, and an integrated Markdown editor for refining the generated content.
