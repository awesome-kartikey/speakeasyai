# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Here are answers to some common questions about SpeakEasyAI.

**1. What is SpeakEasyAI?**

> SpeakEasyAI is a web application that automatically converts your audio or video files into structured blog posts using AI. It handles transcription and content generation, allowing you to easily repurpose your spoken content for your blog.

**2. What file types are supported for upload?**

> You can upload common audio and video file formats. The application checks for `audio/*` or `video/*` MIME types.

**3. What is the maximum file size per upload?**

> The maximum file size allowed per upload is **32MB**. This is configured via the UploadThing service.

**4. How does the AI transcription and blog generation work?**

> - **Transcription:** We use OpenAI's Whisper API to convert the audio from your uploaded file into text.
> - **Blog Generation:** OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini model takes the transcription and context from your previous blog posts (if available) to generate a new blog post in Markdown format. It tries to emulate your writing style and structures the content with a title, introduction, sections, and conclusion.

**5. What are the different subscription plans?**

> SpeakEasyAI offers different plans (e.g., Starter, Basic, Pro) with varying limits on the number of blog posts you can generate per month. Please refer to the Pricing section on the homepage for details. Payments and subscriptions are handled securely via Stripe.

**6. How is my payment information handled?**

> All payments are processed through Stripe, a certified PCI Service Provider Level 1. SpeakEasyAI does not store your full credit card details directly. Stripe webhooks are used to update your subscription status in our system.

**7. How is user authentication managed?**

> We use Clerk for secure user authentication. You can sign up or log in using your email/password, Google account, GitHub account, or Passkeys. Clerk handles all aspects of user sessions and security.

**8. Can I edit the blog posts generated by the AI?**

> Yes! After a blog post is generated, you are redirected to a page with an integrated Markdown editor (`@mdxeditor/editor`). You can fully edit the content, formatting, and structure before publishing or exporting.

**9. Can I export my blog posts?**

> Yes, from the post editor page, there is an "Export" button that allows you to download your edited blog post as a standard Markdown (`.md`) file.

**10. How do I set up the project locally for development?**

> 1.  Clone or fork the repository.
> 2.  Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
> 3.  Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`.
> 4.  Fill in the necessary API keys and secrets (Clerk, Stripe, NeonDb, UploadThing, OpenAI) in `.env.local`.
> 5.  Run the development server using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
> 6.  Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

**11. What database is used?**

> The application uses NeonDb, a serverless distribution of Postgres, for storing user information, post content, and subscription details.

**12. How are file uploads handled securely?**

> File uploads are managed by UploadThing. The process includes authentication middleware (ensuring only logged-in users can upload) handled on the server-side before the upload begins.

**13. What if the AI generation fails or produces poor results?**

> AI generation can sometimes fail due to API issues or produce content that needs refinement.
>
> - **Failures:** The application provides toast notifications for errors. You might need to try uploading again or check the file format/size. If issues persist, contact support (if available) or check the service status pages for OpenAI/UploadThing.
> - **Quality:** Use the built-in Markdown editor to revise the generated content to meet your standards. The AI aims to provide a solid first draft.

**14. Who built this project?**

> This project was built by Ankita Kulkarni (as mentioned in the footer).
