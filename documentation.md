## Forking and Cloning the Project

1.  **Forking:**
    *   Go to the project's repository on the hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
    *   Click the "Fork" button to create a copy of the project in your account.

2.  **Cloning:**
    *   Once forked, go to your forked repository.
    *   Click the "Code" button and copy the repository URL (HTTPS or SSH).
    *   Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project.
    *   Run `git clone <repository-url>` to clone the project to your local machine.
    *   Navigate into the project directory using `cd <project-directory>`.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1.  **Node.js and npm:**
    *   Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed. You can check by running `node -v` and `npm -v` (or `yarn -v`) in your terminal.
    *   If not installed, download and install them from the official Node.js website.

2.  **Dependencies:**
    *   Install the project's dependencies by running `npm install` (or `yarn install`) in the project directory.

3. **Envirnoment Variables:**
    * Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory.
    * Add all the required env variables.
    * Refer to example env if you have.

4.  **Nix (Optional):**
    *   The presence of `.idx/dev.nix` suggests the use of Nix for development environment management.
    *   If you're familiar with Nix, you can use it to create an isolated environment for the project.

## Running the Project

1.  **Development Mode:**
    *   Run `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev`) to start the development server.
    *   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar address specified in the console).

2.  **Production Mode:**
    *   Run `npm run build` (or `yarn build`) to build the project for production.
    *   Run `npm run start` (or `yarn start`) to start the production server.

## Creating a Clone of the Project

1.  **Fork and Clone:** Follow the steps outlined in the "Forking and Cloning the Project" section.
2. **Configuration:** After running the clone you need to ensure configuration for third party such as database, auth, payments and upldoading services.
3.  **Setup:** Follow the steps outlined in the "Setting Up the Development Environment" section.
4.  **Run:** Follow the steps outlined in the "Running the Project" section.

## Code Flow

### Authentication

*   **Routes:**
    *   The `app/(logged-in)/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx` and `app/(logged-in)/sign-up/[[...sign-up]]/page.tsx` files handle sign-in and sign-up routes.
*   **Middleware:**
    *   `middleware.ts` likely redirects unauthorized users to the sign-in page.
*   **User Helpers:**
    *   `lib/user-helpers.ts` probably contains functions for managing user sessions and authentication logic.

### Content Creation and Editing

*   **Components:**
    *   The `components/content/` directory contains components like `content-editor.tsx`, `forward-ref-editor.tsx`, and `mdx-editor.tsx`, which are likely used for creating and editing content.
*   **Actions:**
    *   `actions/edit-actions.ts` might handle actions related to saving, updating, or deleting content.
* **Routes:**
    * The `app/(logged-in)/posts/page.tsx` file shows list of all posts.
    * The `app/(logged-in)/posts/[id]/page.tsx` file is for editing single post.

### Uploading

*   **Components:**
    *   `components/upload/` contains `upgrade-your-plan.tsx` and `upload-form.tsx`, which are related to file uploads.
*   **API:**
    *   `app/api/uploadthing/` contains `core.ts` and `route.ts`, which likely integrate with a service like Uploadthing for handling file uploads.
*   **Actions:**
    *   `actions/upload-actions.ts` might be responsible for handling the upload process.
* **Utils:**
    * `utils/uploadthing.ts`  have configuration of uploadthing.

### Payment Processing

*   **API:**
    *   `app/api/payments/route.ts` handles API requests related to payments.
*   **Helpers:**
    *   `lib/payment-helpers.ts` provides utility functions for payment processing logic.

### Main Layout and Routes

*   **Layout:**
    *   `app/layout.tsx` is the root layout component that wraps all pages.
*   **Homepage:**
    *   `app/page.tsx` renders the homepage.
    *   Components in `components/home/` create the different sections of the homepage.
* **Dashboard**
    * `app/(logged-in)/dashboard/page.tsx` is a dashboard.

## Dependencies

*   **Next.js:** A React framework for building web applications.
*   **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework.
